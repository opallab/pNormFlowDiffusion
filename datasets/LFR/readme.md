These LFR synthetic datasets are from https://github.com/RaniaSalama/Nonlinear_Diffusion/tree/master/LFR_Figures (accessed in January 2020).
We changed data file format for our experiments.

The parameters for the LFR model are:
- n = 1000
- average degree = 10
- maximum degree = 50
- minimum community size = 20
- maximum community size = 100
- power law exponent for the degree distribution = 2
- power law exponent for the community size distribution = 1
