# p-Norm Flow Diffusion

This contains the code to solve primal and dual p-Norm Flow Diffusion problems proposed in the paper "p-Norm Flow Diffusion for Local Graph clustering. Kimon Fountoulakis, Di Wang, Shenghao Yang." The code returns dual variable values that provide node embeddings. The primal flow values are easily recovered from primal-dual optimality conditions.
